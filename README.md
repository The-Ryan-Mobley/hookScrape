## About
This is an improved version of a previous project I worked on before learning React. I used this project to expand upon the original and to test out recursive components using React Hooks.
stuck in an awkward elevator ride and need some slightly interesting facts to make small talk? This website is just for you! this site 
scrapes to trending section of reddit's 'todayilearned' or TIL subreddit. Avoid all the wierd ads disguised as post, and the pop ups
about their app. The site does offer links to both the reddit thread, and the posted link; you can also leave comments by clicking
the associated button.
## How to Use
  When the page loads the user will be presented with a series of post scraped from reddit. The user can click on the title to be directed to the article that was linked on reddit. The user's can view the actual reddit thread by clicking the "VIEW THREAD" button. If user's want to leave or view comments they can click the "COMMENTS" button. The user will then be directed to a seperate page with the post at the top, and a discussion area underneath where they comments (if any) will be displayed. To leave a comment users can click the "LEAVE A COMMENT" button, then a modal will appear where users can input a name and the actual comment body then click post to submit the comment. Once posted the page will relead to display the new comment in the discussion thread. Users can reply to other comments in a similar way by clicking "REPLY" under the comment. if there are more than 3 replies to a comment the thread will collapse with a button that says 'VIEW X REPLIES" that will expand the thread when clicked.
